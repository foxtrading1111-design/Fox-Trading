# New Income Structure Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation introduces a completely new income structure for the trading platform, replacing the old referral system with a more comprehensive multi-level income system.

## Major Changes Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates ✅
- **New fields added to transactions table:**
  - `unlock_date`: Stores 6-month lock period for deposits
  - `referral_level`: Tracks the level (1-20) for team income
  - `monthly_income_source_user_id`: Links team income to the user whose monthly income generated it

- **Performance indexes added:**
  - Index on unlock_date for withdrawal eligibility queries
  - Index on referral_level for team income tracking
  - Composite indexes for optimized income source queries

### 2. Income Logic Changes ✅

#### Old System (Removed):
- 10%, 5%, 3% recurring referral income on every deposit
- Complex multi-level referral cascading

#### New System (Implemented):

**Direct Income:**
- **One-time only**: 10% of referral's first deposit
- No recurring income from the same referral
- Tracked separately with `income_source: 'direct_income'`

**Team Income:**
- Monthly distribution based on team members' earnings
- Multi-level structure (up to 20 levels):
  - Level 1 (Direct): 10% of monthly income
  - Level 2: 5% of monthly income  
  - Level 3: 3% of monthly income
  - Level 4: 2% of monthly income
  - Level 5: 1% of monthly income
  - Levels 6-20: 0.5% each of monthly income
- Tracked with `income_source: 'team_income'`

### 3. Withdrawal Restrictions ✅
- **6-month lock** on all deposited amounts
- Income from direct income, team income, and salary can be withdrawn immediately
- New API endpoint `/api/user/withdrawal/eligibility` checks withdrawal eligibility

### 4. Dashboard Updates ✅

#### Main Dashboard Changes:
- **Total Balance**: Now shows only deposited amount (not wallet balance)
- **Daily Income**: Shows actual daily income amount
- **Total Income**: Shows sum of all income sources (direct, team, salary) excluding deposits

#### New Dashboard Tabs:
1. **Direct Income Tab**: Shows one-time 10% direct referral bonuses
2. **Team Income Tab**: Shows multi-level monthly team income with level breakdown
3. **Salary Income Tab**: Existing rank-based salary system (renamed from MyIncome)
4. **Today Withdrawal Tab**: Shows all withdrawals made today
5. **Total Withdrawal Tab**: Complete withdrawal history with analytics

### 5. New API Endpoints ✅

#### Direct Income:
- `GET /api/user/dashboard/direct-income`
- Returns: totalDirectIncome, todaysDirectIncome, transactions, transactionCount

#### Team Income:
- `GET /api/user/dashboard/team-income`
- Returns: totalTeamIncome, todaysTeamIncome, levelBreakdown, transactions

#### Withdrawal Analytics:
- `GET /api/user/dashboard/today-withdrawal`
- `GET /api/user/dashboard/total-withdrawal`
- `GET /api/user/withdrawal/eligibility`

### 6. Team Income Service ✅
- **New service**: `src/services/teamIncome.js`
- Functions for calculating and distributing team income
- Monthly processing system for team income distribution
- Admin endpoint: `POST /api/user/admin/distribute-team-income`

### 7. Investment Logic Updates ✅
- Modified `src/routes/investment.js`
- Only gives direct income on **first deposit** per user
- Deposits are automatically locked for 6 months
- Stores deposits as `income_source: 'investment_deposit'`

### 8. Frontend Components ✅

#### New Components:
- `TeamIncome.tsx`: Multi-level team income dashboard with charts and level breakdown
