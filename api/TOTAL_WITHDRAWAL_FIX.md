# Total Withdrawal Tab Fix

## Issue
The "Total Withdrawal" on the dashboard was showing **$5,000** when it should show **$0** (or the actual completed withdrawal amount).

## Root Cause
The dashboard was counting ALL `debit` type transactions, including **REJECTED** withdrawals.

```javascript
// OLD CODE (WRONG)
const totalWithdrawalAgg = await prisma.transactions.aggregate({
    _sum: { amount: true },
    where: { user_id: userId, type: 'debit' }
});
```

This counted:
- ✅ Completed withdrawals
- ❌ **REJECTED withdrawals** (should not count!)
- ❌ Pending withdrawals (should not count!)

## The Fix

### File Modified: `src/routes/user.js` (lines 153-164)

**New Code:**
```javascript
// Total withdrawals (only completed withdrawals)
const totalWithdrawalAgg = await prisma.transactions.aggregate({
    _sum: { amount: true },
    where: { 
        user_id: userId, 
        OR: [
            { type: 'debit', income_source: { in: ['withdrawal', 'income_withdrawal', 'investment_withdrawal'] } },
            { type: 'WITHDRAWAL' } // Support old withdrawal format
        ],
        status: 'COMPLETED'
    }
});
```

**Changes:**
1. ✅ Only counts transactions with `status: 'COMPLETED'`
2. ✅ Filters by withdrawal income sources
3. ✅ Supports both new (`debit`) and old (`WITHDRAWAL`) transaction types
4. ✅ Excludes REJECTED and PENDING withdrawals

## Testing Results

### Actual Data in Database:
```
User: cmgkg5nk9001r9z1trkvq6min
├─ Withdrawal #1: $5,000
│  ├─ Type: debit
│  ├─ Income Source: income_withdrawal
│  └─ Status: REJECTED ❌
│
└─ Total Completed Withdrawals: $0.00 ✅
```

### Before Fix:
```
Dashboard showed: $5,000 ❌
(Incorrectly counted REJECTED withdrawal)
```

### After Fix:
```
Dashboard shows: $0.00 ✅
(Only counts COMPLETED withdrawals)
```

## What This Means

**"Total Withdrawal" now correctly shows:**
- ✅ Only **COMPLETED** withdrawals
- ✅ Excludes **REJECTED** withdrawals
- ✅ Excludes **PENDING** withdrawals
- ✅ Works with both old and new transaction formats

**Example Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Status | Old Display | New Display |
|----------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Withdrawal approved | COMPLETED | $100 ✅ | $100 ✅ |
| Withdrawal rejected | REJECTED | $100 ❌ | $0 ✅ |
| Withdrawal pending | PENDING | $100 ❌ | $0 ✅ |
| 2 approved, 1 rejected | Mixed | $300 ❌ | $200 ✅ |

## Other Dashboard Fields (Unchanged)

These fields are working correctly:
- ✅ **Total Balance:** Shows total deposits
- ✅ **Daily Income:** Shows today's income (excludes deposits)
- ✅ **Total Income:** Shows lifetime income
- ✅ **Direct Income:** Shows referral income
- ✅ **Team Income:** Shows multi-level income
- ✅ **Today's Withdrawal:** Shows withdrawals made today

## Deployment

1. **Restart backend:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Verify on dashboard:**
   - "Total Withdrawal" should now show only completed withdrawals
   - Rejected/Pending withdrawals should not be counted

**Status:** ✅ FIXED AND TESTED
**Date:** 2025-10-11
**File Changed:** `src/routes/user.js`
**Impact:** Dashboard "Total Withdrawal" now accurately reflects only approved/completed withdrawals
