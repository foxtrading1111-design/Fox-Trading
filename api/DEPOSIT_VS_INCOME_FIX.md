# Complete Fix: Deposit vs Income Withdrawal Logic

## ✅ All Issues Resolved

### Problem Statement
The system was not properly separating:
1. **Deposits** (investment principal - locked for 6 months)
2. **Income** (profits from referrals, team, salary - immediately withdrawable)

### What Was Fixed

## 1. Dashboard "Total Balance" ✅
**Fixed in:** `src/routes/user.js` (line 243)

**What it shows:** Total amount deposited through the website

**Before:** Was showing wallet.balance (deposits + income - withdrawals)  
**After:** Shows only `depositedAmountAgg._sum.amount` (total deposits only)

**Example:** If you deposit $100, Total Balance = $100

---

## 2. Dashboard "Daily Income" ✅
**Fixed in:** `src/routes/user.js` (lines 120-137)

**What it shows:** Only income earned TODAY (excludes deposits)

**Before:** Counted ALL credit transactions (including deposits)  
**After:** Only counts income sources: `direct_income`, `team_income`, `salary_income`, `monthly_profit`

**Example:** 
- Deposit $100 today → Daily Income = $0
- Earn $10 referral income today → Daily Income = $10

---

## 3. Withdrawal Income Page ✅
**Already correct in:** `src/routes/withdrawal.js` (lines 514-546)

**What it shows:** Available withdrawable income (profits only, not deposits)

**Calculation:**
```
Available Balance = Total Income Earned - Already Withdrawn
```

**Income Sources:**
- Direct referral income (10% one-time)
- Team income (multi-level)
- Salary income
- Monthly investment profits

**Lock Period:** NONE (immediate withdrawal)

---

## 4. Withdrawal Investment Page ✅
**Already correct in:** `src/routes/withdrawal.js` (lines 443-504)

**What it shows:** Deposited amounts with 6-month lock status

**Two Categories:**
1. **Locked Deposits:** Cannot withdraw yet (< 6 months old)
2. **Unlocked Deposits:** Can withdraw (> 6 months old)

**Lock Period:** 6 MONTHS from deposit date

---

## 5. Deposit Approval Process ✅
**Fixed in:** `src/routes/admin.js` (lines 240-249 & 322-325)

**Changes:**
1. When admin approves deposit → `unlock_date` set to 6 months from now
2. When referral income created → `unlock_date` set to immediately (current date)
3. Referral level tracking added

**Example:**
```javascript
// Deposit approved on Jan 1, 2025
unlock_date: July 1, 2025  // 6 months later

// Referral income created
unlock_date: Jan 1, 2025   // Immediately withdrawable
```

## Complete Data Flow

### When User Deposits $100:

1. **User submits deposit request**
   - Transaction created with status: `PENDING`
   - No wallet balance update yet

2. **Admin approves deposit**
   - Transaction status → `COMPLETED`
   - `unlock_date` → 6 months from now (🔒 LOCKED)
   - Wallet balance += $100
   - Referral income processed (if applicable)

3. **Dashboard shows:**
   - Total Balance: $100 ✅
   - Daily Income: $0 ✅ (no income, just deposit)

4. **Withdrawal pages show:**
   - Withdrawal Income → Available: $0 ✅
   - Withdrawal Investment → Locked: $100 ✅

---

### When User Earns $10 Referral Income:

1. **System creates referral transaction**
   - Type: `credit`
   - Income source: `direct_income`
   - `unlock_date`: current date (✅ IMMEDIATELY WITHDRAWABLE)
   - Wallet balance += $10

2. **Dashboard shows:**
   - Total Balance: $100 ✅ (still shows only deposits)
   - Daily Income: $10 ✅ (income earned today)
   - Total Income: $10 ✅ (lifetime income)

3. **Withdrawal pages show:**
   - Withdrawal Income → Available: $10 ✅
   - Withdrawal Investment → Locked: $100 ✅
