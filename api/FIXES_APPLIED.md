# Fixes Applied - Deposit vs Income Separation

## Issue Reported
When a user deposits $100, it was incorrectly showing in "Daily Income" instead of only in "Total Balance".

## Root Cause
The `daily_income` calculation was including ALL credit transactions (including deposits), when it should only include actual income earnings.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Daily Income Calculation (src/routes/user.js)
**Line 120-137**

**Before:**
```javascript
const dailyIncomeAgg = await prisma.transactions.aggregate({
    _sum: { amount: true },
    where: {
        user_id: userId,
        type: 'credit',
        timestamp: { gte: today, lt: tomorrow }
    }
});
```

**After:**
```javascript
const dailyIncomeAgg = await prisma.transactions.aggregate({
    _sum: { amount: true },
    where: {
        user_id: userId,
        type: 'credit',
        timestamp: { gte: today, lt: tomorrow },
        income_source: { 
            in: ['direct_income', 'team_income', 'salary_income', 'daily_profit', 'monthly_profit']
        },
        status: 'COMPLETED'
    }
});
```

### 2. Fixed Total Balance Display (src/routes/user.js)
**Line 242-243**

**Before:**
```javascript
wallet_balance: depositedAmountAgg._sum.amount ?? 0, // Show only deposited amount as total balance
daily_income: dailyIncomeAgg._sum.amount ?? 0, // Today's income
```

**After:**
```javascript
wallet_balance: Number(wallet.balance) ?? 0, // Total wallet balance (deposits + income - withdrawals)
daily_income: dailyIncomeAgg._sum.amount ?? 0, // Today's income (only from income sources, not deposits)
```

### 3. Fixed Deposit Aggregation (src/routes/user.js)
**Line 88-97**

Updated to properly capture all deposit types (BEP20_deposit, TRC20_deposit, etc.)

## What These Fields Now Represent

### Daily Income
- **What it shows:** Only income earned TODAY (referral, team, salary, profits)
- **What it excludes:** Deposits made today
- **Updates:** Daily (resets at midnight)

### Total Balance
- **What it shows:** Complete wallet balance
- **Includes:** All deposits + All income - All withdrawals
- **Source:** Direct from wallets table (real-time)

### Total Income
- **What it shows:** Lifetime total income from all sources
- **Includes:** direct_income, team_income, salary_income, profits
- **What it excludes:** Deposits
- **Updates:** Accumulates over time

### Total Investment
- **What it shows:** Total amount deposited
- **Source:** Sum of all deposit transactions
- **Purpose:** Track total invested capital

## Testing Results

Ran test script with a fresh $100 deposit:
- ✅ Daily Income: $0.00 (correct - no income earned today)
- ✅ Total Balance: $100.00 (correct - shows the deposit)
- ✅ Deposits properly excluded from daily income calculation

## Files Modified

1. `src/routes/user.js` - Dashboard endpoint (/dashboard)
2. `src/routes/withdrawal.js` - Withdrawal stats and validation (already fixed previously)

## Database Fields Used

- `transactions.type` = 'credit' | 'debit'
- `transactions.income_source` = 'direct_income' | 'team_income' | 'salary_income' | 'monthly_profit' | 'BEP20_deposit' | etc.
- `wallets.balance` = Total available balance

## Deployment Notes

✅ Backend restart required for changes to take effect
✅ No database migration needed
✅ No frontend changes needed
✅ Backward compatible with existing data

## Verified Endpoints

- ✅ GET /api/user/dashboard - Main dashboard stats
- ✅ GET /api/withdrawal/stats - Withdrawal available balance
- ✅ POST /api/withdrawal/income - Income withdrawal validation
- ✅ GET /api/user/dashboard/direct-income - Direct income tab
- ✅ GET /api/user/dashboard/team-income - Team income tab
- ✅ GET /api/user/dashboard/monthly-profit - Monthly profit tab
