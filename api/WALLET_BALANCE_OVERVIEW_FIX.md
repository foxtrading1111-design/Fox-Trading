# Wallet Balance Overview Fix

## Issue
The "Wallet Balance Overview" on the Add Withdrawal Address page was showing incorrect data.

**Screenshot showed:**
- Total Balance: $5,910 ❌
- Withdrawable: $5,910 ❌
- Locked: $0 ❌
- Net Withdrawable: $5,909 ❌

## Root Cause
The `/api/user/wallet-balance` endpoint was using the OLD logic:
- **Total Balance:** Showed `wallet.balance` (deposits + income combined)
- **Locked:** Only showed PENDING withdrawals
- **Withdrawable:** Total - Locked

This didn't properly separate deposits from income or account for the 6-month lock.

## The Fix

### File Modified: `src/routes/user.js` (lines 1095-1173)

**Complete Rewrite of the endpoint:**

```javascript
// OLD CODE (WRONG)
const totalBalance = wallet.balance;
const lockedBalance = pending withdrawals;
const withdrawableBalance = totalBalance - lockedBalance;
```

**NEW CODE (CORRECT):**
```javascript
// 1. Total Balance = Total Deposits
const totalDeposits = aggregate(deposits);

// 2. Locked = Locked Deposits (6-month lock)
const lockedDeposits = aggregate(deposits where unlock_date > now);

// 3. Withdrawable = Unlocked Income - Withdrawn
const withdrawableIncome = aggregate(income where unlock_date <= now);
const totalWithdrawn = aggregate(withdrawals);
const withdrawableBalance = withdrawableIncome - totalWithdrawn;

// 4. Net Withdrawable = Withdrawable - Fee
const netWithdrawable = withdrawableBalance - withdrawalFee;
```

## What Each Field Now Shows

### 1. **Total Balance**
- **Shows:** Total amount deposited through website
- **Source:** Sum of all completed deposit transactions
- **Example:** If you deposited $100, shows $100

### 2. **Withdrawable**
- **Shows:** Available income that can be withdrawn NOW
- **Source:** Unlocked income minus already withdrawn amounts
- **Includes:** Direct income, team income, salary, profits
- **Excludes:** Locked deposits, already withdrawn amounts
- **Example:** Earned $50 income, withdrew $10 → shows $40

### 3. **Locked**
- **Shows:** Deposits still in 6-month lock period
- **Source:** Deposits where `unlock_date > current date`
- **Example:** Deposited $100 today → shows $100 locked

### 4. **Net Withdrawable**
- **Shows:** Withdrawable amount after deducting $1 fee
- **Calculation:** Withdrawable - $1.00
- **Example:** Withdrawable is $50 → Net is $49

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New User with $100 Deposit
```
Total Balance:    $100  (deposited)
Withdrawable:     $0    (no income yet)
Locked:           $100  (6-month lock)
Net Withdrawable: $0    (no income to withdraw)
```

### Scenario 2: User with $100 Deposit + $50 Income
```
Total Balance:    $100  (deposited)
Withdrawable:     $50   (earned income)
Locked:           $100  (deposit still locked)
Net Withdrawable: $49   ($50 - $1 fee)
```

### Scenario 3: After 6 Months
```
Total Balance:    $100  (deposited)
Withdrawable:     $50   (earned income - can't withdraw deposits here)
Locked:           $0    (6 months passed, but deposit withdrawal is separate)
Net Withdrawable: $49   ($50 - $1 fee)
```

## Deployment

1. **Restart backend:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Verify on page:**
   - Go to Settings → Add Withdrawal Address

- ✅ **Net Withdrawable** = Withdrawable - $1 fee
- ✅ Deposits can only be withdrawn through "Withdrawal Investment" page after 6 months
- ✅ Income can be withdrawn immediately through "Withdrawal Income" page
